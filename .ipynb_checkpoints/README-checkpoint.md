## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images 
of various sports. The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately identify the 
sport being played in a given image. By leveraging deep learning techniques and image processing, 
our project demonstrates how neural networks can be applied to real-world classification problems 
within sports and computer vision domains.

## Project Goals



## Dataset

Our dataset consists of images labeled across 100 different sports categories, 
providing a diverse range of activities for classification. The dataset includes 
a total of 13,492 images for training, with additional subsets for validation 
and testing to measure model performance. Each class captures various aspects of 
each sport, including:

- Basketball
- Football
- Soccer
- Tennis
- Baseball
- Swimming
- And many more...

The images vary in style, lighting, and perspective, making this dataset 
well-suited for training a robust model that can generalize across real-world 
sports images. We applied preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to 
enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.
